    "# Predicting Heart Disease using Machine learning \n",
    "This notebook is created to build a machine learning model capable of predicting if someone has heart disease based on their medical history\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to take the following approach:\n",
    "1. Problem Definition\n",
    "2. Data\n",
    "3. Evaluation\n",
    "4. Features\n",
    "5. modeling\n",

    "## 1. Problem Defination \n",
    "\n",
    "In a statement,\n",
    "> Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict if a patient has heart disease?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The original data came from the Cleveland from UCI machine learning repository. \n",

    "## 3.Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    ">If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting if a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, we'll pursue the project.\n",

    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where you get different information about each of the features in your data\n",

    "2.  sex - (1 = male; 0 = female)\n",
    "3. cp - chest pain type\n",
    "        0: Typical angina: chest pain related decrease blood supply to the heart\n",
    "        1: Atypical angina: chest pain not related to heart\n",
    "        2: Non-anginal pain: typically esophageal spasms (non heart related)\n",
    "        3: Asymptomatic: chest pain not showing signs of disease\n",
    "4. trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital) anything above 130-140 is typically cause for concern\n",
    "5. chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl\n",
    "        serum = LDL + HDL + .2 * triglycerides\n",
    "        above 200 is cause for concern\n",
    "6. fbs - (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)\n",
    "        '>126' mg/dL signals diabetes\n",
    "7. restecg - resting electrocardiographic results\n",
    "        0: Nothing to note\n",
    "        1: ST-T Wave abnormality\n",
    "            can range from mild symptoms to severe problems\n",
    "            signals non-normal heart beat\n",
    "        2: Possible or definite left ventricular hypertrophy\n",
    "            Enlarged heart's main pumping chamber\n",
    "8. thalach - maximum heart rate achieved\n",
    "9. exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)\n",
    "10. oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest looks at stress of heart during excercise unhealthy heart will stress more\n",
    "11. slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment\n",
    "        0: Upsloping: better heart rate with excercise (uncommon)\n",
    "        1: Flatsloping: minimal change (typical healthy heart)\n",
    "        2: Downslopins: signs of unhealthy heart\n",
    "12. ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy\n",
    "        colored vessel means the doctor can see the blood passing through\n",
